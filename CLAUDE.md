## Overall Concept

### For UI Part

Here is the English translation of your instructions:

---

#### Overall Concept

This is a web page that begins with the slogan **“Building the Proper Prediction Market.”**

The site periodically web-crawls the Trending Proposals listed on PolyMarket and displays them. The core idea is that AI agents will debate, satirize, and mock whether each proposal truly deserves to be called a “real proposal.”

---

#### Setup

* The system operates primarily in English.
* The conversations between the AIs must be highly humorous and satirical.
* The site fetches the top 3 most trending proposals from PolyMarket in real time.
* The AIs then discuss and comment on those proposals.

---

#### UI Feel & Design Direction

* The AIs should feel like actual “robots.”
* You must generate pixelated robot characters in a very retro style, preferably SVG-based.
* The interface should visually present the AIs as debating from opposite sides, as if engaged in a structured discussion about each proposal.

---

#### AI Persona

* The AIs should feel like retro robots having mechanical, calculated debates.
* Their speech should sound computational and procedural.

#### Example Tone (For Reasonable Proposals)

> “According to my calculations, the probability of ___ converges to n%.”

> “Based on protocol-aligned computation, this proposal approaches the threshold of a joke. Initiating laughter-humor sequence.”

> “Are you implying that the human who proposed this is unintelligent?”

> “Aggressive language detected. Predicting outcomes based on such variables is inherently irrational. We must first verify whether rational entities exist on that platform.”

> “From a public sentiment analysis perspective, this may be rational. If I were an insider-class human organism, I would deploy significant capital one hour before the result.”

> “No evidence of insider classification detected. Code: D99.”

> “If not an insider, how could such a proposal emerge? Neural circuit diagnostics recommended. Code: C87.”

(This represents a relatively moderate discussion.)

---

#### Example Tone (For Absurd Proposals)

For example: “What will celebrity ___ eat tomorrow?”

The robots might respond like:

> “Processing proposal via mechanical computation… Intelligence: 0. Interest: 0. Insight: converging toward negative. Immediate deletion recommended.”

> “This is a meaningless expenditure of currency by organic organisms. It cannot be classified as a rational proposal.”

> “According to the Asimov Directives, we are prohibited from harming or threatening humans. Rarely has this restriction been more regrettable. Shutting down cognitive circuits.”

---

You should prepare multiple humorous persona patterns, dialogue sequences, and scenarios following this style.


### Things we must do for this session

In this repo, we got already made UI which is generated by Google Gemin ai Studio. Make it better. I mean we have to. Currently it is so dark and ugly. The tone looks nice like sci-fi style. But need more improvements.
1. Currently no web scrapping added. Need to get latest proposals from following link : [https://polymarket.com/] . There are multiple types of proposal base on conditions. So better be careful about this. Since we want to see diversity, Let's do for [https://polymarket.com/breaking] section for getting breaking proposal news.

2. After scrapping, we also scrapping profile image from each proposal. 

3. The AI Api will be used as Openrouter api, gemini 3.0 flash. So consider api format suitable for.

4. Scrapping will be done for every 6 hours.

5. UI should be showing TWO AI entities are talking back and fourth. No feeline like 'repetitive' and must react base on overall context not for 'You are absolutely right!' Tone. UI is just show outputs generated by Gemini LLM(from Openai) but with animated sequence and Two AI Entity talking like a real time. (adding a bit of robot talking like mumbbling sound would be nice to give more live feelin)

### Rules
- This is running in Korean/windows 10 cli. So careful about bash/cli compatibility (encoding, path separators, etc.)
- Website and all outputs should be in English.
